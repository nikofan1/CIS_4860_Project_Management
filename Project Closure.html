      <h3>4.1 Budget Performance</h3>
      <p>No unexpected or additional costs for this project.</p>

      <h3>4.2 Schedule Performance</h3>
      <p>Schedules were on time most of the time, but I ran a little behind at the beginning of the project because I needed to change my project goal.</p>

      <h2>Risk and Issue Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The project goal was not specific at the beginning and I had to change my work breakdown structure. 
        I also changed my project tool from Excel to Monday as well. 
        No major risk, it was just a delay in the project.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <h3>What went well?</h3>
      <p>Weekly team check-ins kept everyone on track, and breaking down the work breakdown structure was really helpful.</p>

      <h3>What didn’t go well?</h3>
      <p>Participating in a career fair was a bit challenging; I needed to push it back a few weeks because there were none.</p>

      <h3>What Would You Do Differently?</h3>
      <p>I wouldn’t do anything differently, maybe be more specific in my project goal in the beginning.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaway for Future Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Completing LinkedIn Learning courses took longer than planned. 
        Future projects should build in learning curves and plan ahead for unfamiliar tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times, decisions made earlier in the project were difficult to recall during final reporting. 
        Keeping decision logs or brief notes ensures clarity on rationale and supports accountability.
