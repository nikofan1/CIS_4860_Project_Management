        <h3>Conversation Summary</h3>
        <p>
          I shared with Anthony that I am working toward becoming a web developer and that I am currently
          learning HTML, SQL, and JavaScript. I also showed him my project charter and explained how I am
          breaking down the project step by step. He appreciated my approach and said it reflected how real
          projects are managed in software engineering.
        </p>

          Since he works on many projects, I asked him, “What qualities do you look for in people you work
          with?” He explained that he values reliability, clear communication, and strong collaboration. He
          also emphasized the importance of showing respect for others and staying flexible when circumstances
          change.

        <h3>Conversation Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Before beginning our conversation, I asked if I could record the discussion for my project, and he
          agreed. I shared my project charter with him and explained that I am taking a project management
          course. I then asked him, “How do you use project management in your job?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Frederick explained that project management helps him stay organized and ensure that tasks are
          completed efficiently and on schedule. In IT operations, he breaks projects into smaller, manageable
          steps to track progress and identify issues early.
